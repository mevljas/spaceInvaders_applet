# Space Invaders Java applet edition
The goal of the project is to create a Java applet based video game (for some reason, Java applet development is still taught in my high school) . It is based on the once popular Space Invaders game and contains many improvements. The goal of the game is to win all the levels by defeating all of the opponents and scoring as many points as possible. The main purpose of the game is to operate a spacecraft, shoot at the enemies and avoid their missiles. It consists of three different levels, which the player has to play through. The game is made in the Java programming language with addition of HTTMl and CSS.
